# Index

This is an index of past and current open source projects, ordered by last substantive commit. All items were updated to dead as of November 2017 - Focus is now on helping independent consultants net $250k by negotiating higher billing rates. To give you guys a free gift for checking me out here however I have made all of my courses on Teachable free, including the deep learning on the Amazon Web Services cloud course and the real estate feedforward neural network example that used real Vermont/New Hampshire data to predict closing prices with stunning accuracy: [SuperiorCourses.Teachable.com](http://superiorcourses.teachable.com).

**alive**: in development  
**finished**: project goals met, implies usability & death  
**usable**: project is useful/runnable <br>
**dead**: no further development planned

# The Terrible Deep Learning List

Here are 15 open source deep learning models that programmers interested in deep learning can download and run first try. Seeing these examples come to life for the first time feels like magic. I want other programmers to experience this wonder.
This is a *terrible* deep learning list. No attempt has been made to "cover all the bases" of the field of deep learning.
But - If you have never "dived deep" into Deep Learning and just want to try something out, these examples are for you! 

Remember, if you're getting into deep learning - *change the world!*
