| [i think one of the market wizards chris camillo too got married in his mid 20's but it was while working a job where he was making over 6 figures… after getting married he made like 68% annual returns for 10 years… he’s an extremely social guy... he is in early PIPE deals and gets pre-IPO shares too... so although he’s a solo trader he has made lots of friends and this sociability and maybe the marriage too has enabled him to be a market wizard now let’s look at the other side so on the other hand dux is not married, makes $5m/yr jack kellogg is not married yet qullamaggie makes $5m/yr and is not married Sykes is not married one of the main tie ups with having a long term committed relationship while trading or in entrepreneurship is the big time commitment the relationship will take so](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241033819317809152/) |  i made a tier list in order of what takes the least time to what takes the most time and the effect of the relationship on the chance of financial success take a look here is the tier list: Tier 1: supportive of trading partner - I’ve heard of this but never experienced it firsthand, this is the best and takes the least time because you support each other and it even gives you energy Tier 2: completely single - i mean celibacy, this is not going to lead to kids and a long term relationship, it doesn’t get any easier as you get older either, this tier takes no time which is great but you lose energy from not feeling like you’re driving emotionally to bring kids into this world…you can agree or disagree with me on that one that’s just my opinion by the way i am in this tier 2 of completely single - after coming out of a relationship this tier of almost monk like focus has enabled me to get to the point where I am at now trading-wise which is a pretty good spot in my opinion and i am set up well for the future too at least when it comes to trading because of it but i’d like to move to tier 1 - the great relationship that gives you energy in order to get to tier 1 you have to go through tier 3 first - the actively single tier | TikTok Tier List | October 2024 | alive | a month |
| [Tier 3: actively single - nothing takes more time than this, it’s also a lot of fun and confidence boosting to get the validation of a lot of different people liking you, this is a little gross but your body count goes up and that validation feels good although that’s not necessarily a sign you’re moving in a good long term direction and your trading account definitely does not go up - in short, this is probably a positive place to be for your social and physical health but you are an idiot if you stay here for too long in my opinion and you may lose money if you spend too much time here](discord.gg/5kEmNKXqq3) | Tier 4: unsupportive partner - this takes the most energy from you of all the tiers, if you pick the wrong partner this removes your ability to trade for a living because your unsupportive partner will eventually force you to pick between trading and being their partner, this tier is worse than being single because to try to keep the relationship you will end up back in the job world and your trading will fall by the wayside which is just not an option if you want to make trading work what do you think? you may call this overthinking which it is and say Sam the answer is to go out and get plastered and let the chips fall where they may… or just do what feels right...it’s a fine answer but no one with a lot of success in trading picked trading as a career haphazardly so why would they go about picking a partner with the same nonchalance trade on | the long game | September 2024 | alive | a month |

| [I just wanted to make sure you understand it was not my intention to post videos of students on my social media. The tripod attachment I use uses facial recognition software to only focus on my face and body, so that I can move in the poses and be recorded. The footage is then edited automatically using software. I made a mistake relying on this technology to only record myself and on using technology that edited the video. It was my intention to provide content of the class and to share content on my personal social media, because I believed students who may be interested in taking the class may want to know a little more about the instructor and what the class is. In doing so, I believed they would probably search the name of the instructor and I was aware of the search engine rankings which would surface my TikTok social media as one of the first results for my name.

Buy it. It might be a real company!2. Look at the price ~ did the price go sideways this year. If it did that is exceptional because this was a horrible year for companies 📉 3. Look for a special document from the Securities and Exchange Commission ` i know it sounds like a lot but it's really not ` you can do it... the documents are legalesey but you can do search using the find tool for words like "warrants" to see when people are going to cash out! For this billionaire company - it's just a form with a number like when you file your taxes ... Form FOUR! Form FOUR means rich connected people like Nancy Pelosi may have bought the stock because good friends told them to :) In this case executives bought hundreds of thousands of shares one week before this billion dollar buyout.

Hosted by Dartmouth farm hand and part-time lab manager at the Dartmouth Digital Applied Learning Lab Dillon Trient, Dartmouth Horse Dads is a podcast that covers what it takes to support a Big Green student-athlete equestrian as a dad and what support means before and after graduation. The podcast aims to be a lighthearted way to help equestrians transition from student-athletes to working professionals without losing connection to their sport. Dartmouth Horse Dads recognizes the people behind the scenes that help make the Dartmouth Equestrian Team successful and maybe someday will help Big Green equestrians to discover connections to their alumni network.

| [as below average 'full-time trader' who take afternoon and after hours off (sorry jedi-but-tradeaholic jack, not trying to get wrecked on afternoon fakeouts or squeezed after close on top, cxai, mltx, vtgn that neither intuition nor data can predict). Let’s be clear, this 3/4 leaf chat room is 5 stars compared to any other paid small cap trading chatroom in the world. Now let’s get into the nitty gritty. I am halfway between insecure around and "over" inflexibly-long but lovable dom, talkaholic/sketch-track-record but social connector huddie and zero balls but manage-my-money kyle but specifically “over” all long-only (qullamaggie, Ariel, Valkyrie exceptions as they short too) and def short system traders (your system is “you” you nerd idiots) who grew exponentially during the 2020 (ya i heard of sys traders w “zero system risk” who blew up 500k+ account on halts in 2022), downright skept of garden variety '20- jan/feb '21 bubble millionaire teaching strategies on today market having 1/100th liquidity especially to small account hovering on poverty. yes hanlin got big in 22 shorting china pumps but he start w 50k+ or smthing (?) and took big risk, def not sykes 'pattern'. big risk definitely only way to catch up to clovers until 2040 when shortbear predict next bubble. small account need compounding and newb cant wait around for plays that are A+ for 500k+ accounts (yes i know 500k accounts have many 30-50k accts but newb have half their win rate or terrible risk/reward so compound negligable). ](https://kinfo.com/portfolio/20743/performance) | better to short a lot and scalp, including, yes, including premarket day 1 gappers (w stops!) (yes, you ahve to learn to read at 5th grade level and not short primary endpoint met) cant be waiting around for short "pattern" trades that come a few times a month (btw obviously long pattern trades havent been working for multiple years, i dont know why anyone at all has kept longing since 2021 and not gone to shorting, that is insane asylum behavior, short now and long when market gets hot again you braindead idealists - to give credit where credit is due jack is vocal about this intermittently, Kyle rarely longs, and huddie and dom would probably admit it if you asked), you cant limit yourself to these "pattern" trades when ou are stuck with a share size limit or margin requirements that stop you from making even a thousand bucks on this "monster setup" while these guys post their gains that are more than you made all year and tell you to just "learn the setups" and "be patient", bro i cant be patient because there is not another bubble coming... i need repeatable and frequent, recurring setups... skeptical of all day fade "calls" when clearly see after 10:45 everything squeeze back to open price (beside low float icct or vfs "first red day" of course cant even call it first red day until its already happened).  | need learn people doing well in current market (yes, dreaded "scalpers" who "suck at trading" but can actually pay their rent in this market not traders with huge accounts huge one day gains and relatively modest returns on year (btw biggest trader by volume on guardian was brian lee who self identify as scalper although concede even he was breakeven in 22). need to hear from small acct growth ppl playing illiquid plays that yes wont help millionaires but actually will help students become 100kionaires. also skeptical of the chatrooms's students w posts of big gains that have no kinfo or broker record or stamp of approval from verified traders. not going to jack off to your 20k win when no nothing of account size or past performance. nothing worse than millionaire biz owners who made money elsewhere playing market like casino and lauded in chat for “woa, big number = big swinging dick”. Show all your trades or shut up. With all those cons out of the way, let me just say I would never take the time to review a product I didn’t think has the potential to be life changing and the clovers are trying really hard to be the best chatroom out there (the cobra of chatrooms). This chat is still easily 5 stars despite all these drawbacks that i think the clovers probably half believe/ are aware of already. no better value out there. happy paying customer | April 2023 | alive | a month |
